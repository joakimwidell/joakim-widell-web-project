2021-2-26 12.13 Summary of project: Handing in GIT reposity now, uploading video. A lot of improvements can still be made on this website, but the functionality is there. I feel like I have made a good representation of API usage, will most likely continue to improve on visual and some functional aspects of this page on my own time though. All in all I will say I have learned alot about front end development in the process of this project, and it is a field in which I most likely wont work, but do want to get better at.
2021-2-26 Daily plan: Record presentation and attempt to find a fix for non-refreshing HTML. It might be a problem thats hard coded at this point, which means I wont have a possiblity to fix it before the deadline.
2021-2-26 Project on GITHUB seems to have vanished, can see at least one of the previous activities in my issues but I am getting a 404 error when I click the link for it. See files ProjectGone + ProjectGone2 for verification. I will be posting a new project with roughly the same content as the previous one as a placeholder for the final hand-in on the assignment.
2021-2-25 19.51 Summary: Worked out layout, still have not found a solution for automatic HTML code swap. Requires a reload in order to swap into mobile version.
2021-2-25 08.41 Daily plan: Improvements on mobile compatibility.  
2021-2-25 08.40 Got no work done yesterday due to family matters, will catch up on whatever was missed and finish up project today/tomorrow within the expected timeframe however.
2021-2-23 16.48 Summary: Still working on tweaking layout, functionality is finalized and working properly.
2021-2-23 10:38 Daily plan: Fine tuning of graphical elements. Improve the layout for a better feel.
2021-2-23 08:37 Summary of yesterday: API has been integrated, modifying the graphical and funtion layout is still not finished. 
2021-2-22 09.34 Daily plan: Integrate API fully, work on alternate solutions for a better looking layout.
2021-2-19 10.39 Daily plan: Revise if current API is actually usable since it requires standalone graphics to operate as intended. Will stick with it if embedding is plausible. Otherwise will move on to another subject.
2021-2-19 10.38 Summary of yesterday: Ran into issues with API functionality, in doing so forgot to update logbook. Have now managed to import data from said API and project is progressing.
2021-2-18 09.44 Daily plan: Work on API functionality, potentially find a new one seince the current one relies on built in GUI to work. Clean up layout if time allows. 
2021-2-17 17.30 Layout mostly done, need to use same template to migrate to mobile devices however. Should be a quick solve with some reformatting. API still not properly connected.
2021-2-17 11.45 Daily plan: Finalize layout, start working on API functionality.  
2021-2-16 14.40 Worked on layout, added "about" and "log in" pages. Found API for use.
2021-2-16 09.29 Daily plan: Resume work on layout, look at API's for content.
2021-2-15 17.12 Created beginning of a layout for template. GIT is up and running, PSUEDO code in place for assistance in finishing layout.
2021-2-15 12:43 Daily plan: Create visual representation of webpage design, localize and install additional extensions for VSCode, start on PSUEDO code for HTML and CSS, create GIT project and fill out required details.
