            <h1>On the page you will find a function calling to an API provided by Songsterr.com. At first my intention was to use their API perform a search that returns data needed to direct you to the correct tablature page. After the search was completed my intention was to use an IFrame to reflect the content found on this page. This was just not possible though. There was an "x-frame deny" clause in the webpage itself, meaning that embedding the graphical elements couldn't be done, at least not in any way I could figure out aside from recreating the whole thing myself.</h1></div>
        <div id="box-bottom-content-home">
            <h1>So the solution I finally landed on was to create a search function that instead links to their website, not really a useful function since the page just becomes a very limited search engine. But the search function itself does rely entirely on using an API in order to fetch the proper information needed for creating my elements. With the API I retreive details about the songs/artists that makes it possible to firstly: Create a list with the artists containing their songs that have a tablature available on the site, and secondly: to make the list elements into links that can redirect you directly to the tablatures.</h1></div>
